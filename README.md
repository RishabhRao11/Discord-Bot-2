# Anti-Swear Discord Bot

A simple personal-use Discord bot designed to automatically detect and filter profanity in chat messages. This bot helps keep conversations clean by monitoring messages in real time and responding whenever banned words are used.

## Features:

Profanity detection — Identifies swear words or offensive terms in user messages.

Automatic warnings — Sends a message reminding users not to swear (customizable).

Real-time monitoring — Reacts instantly when banned words are used.

Simple and lightweight — Built for personal use, easy to modify and expand.

## Purpose:

This bot was created as a personal project to experiment with Discord bot development, message handling, and moderation logic. It’s not meant to be a full moderation system, just a lightweight tool for learning and fun.

## How It Works:

The bot listens to incoming messages in any server it’s added to.

When it detects a word from your profanity list, it sends a warning message (e.g., “Don’t swear!”).

The banned words list can be customized directly in the code.

## Notes:

This bot is intended only for personal use.

Behavior and messages can be tuned depending on what you want your bot to do.

Improvements, extra commands, and more filters can be easily added.
